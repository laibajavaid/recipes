            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol class="prep-list">
                <li>Prep your green things: Trim roots and leggy stalks from <strong>1 bunch mature spinach (9–12
                        oz)</strong>. Wash
                    well and spin or pat dry; coarsely chop. Coarsely chop leaves and tender stems from <strong>1 small
                        bunch dill</strong>
                    to make ½ cup. Set a few tender sprigs aside for serving; reserve remaining dill for another
                    use.</li>
                <li>Bring <strong>8 cups water</strong> to a boil in a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot. Add
                    <strong>1 tbsp plus 1½ tsp vegetable bouillon paste (preferably Better Than Bouillon) or 4 cubes
                        bouillon (or follow the
                        package instructions)</strong>
                    and whisk to dissolve. (Alternatively, you can heat <strong>8 cups vegetable stock or
                        low-sodium vegetable broth</strong> if you prefer). Add <strong>10 oz. cheese, spinach, or
                        mushroom tortellini</strong> and
                    cook 3 minutes (or according to package directions), then remove from heat. Using a spider, slotted
                    spoon, or fine-mesh sieve, divide among bowls.
                </li>
                <li>Cut <strong>1 lemon</strong> in half and squeeze juice through your hand or a fine-mesh sieve into a
                    small bowl. You
                    should have ¼ cup; repeat with <strong>another lemon</strong> if you need a little more juice.</li>
                <li>Whisk lemon juice, <strong>4 large eggs</strong>, and <strong>1 tsp freshly ground black
                        pepper</strong> in a medium bowl or large
                    measuring glass to combine.</li>
                <li>Return broth to a gentle simmer. Scoop out about 1 cup and very gradually drizzle into egg mixture,
                    whisking constantly. (This step, called tempering, warms up the delicate eggs slowly so that they
                    don’t scramble when you add them to the rest of the hot broth.) The egg mixture should be quite warm
                    to the touch—if not, whisk in more broth.</li>
                <li>Whisking constantly, gradually pour warm egg mixture into broth in pot. Cook, whisking often, over
                    medium heat, until slightly thickened, 5–7 minutes. (Do not let broth come to a full boil.) Taste
                    and season with <strong>kosher salt and more pepper</strong> if needed. If your broth is really
                    salty, you might need
                    to add a bit of water to dilute the soup. </li>
                <li>Remove from heat and add spinach and chopped dill (the spinach will wilt immediately.)</li>
                <li>Ladle broth into bowls with tortellini. Drizzle with <strong>extra-virgin olive oil</strong> and
                    shave or finely
                    grate <strong>Parmesan</strong> over. Sprinkle with a little pepper and top with remaining reserved
                    dill sprigs.</li>
                <li><strong>Do ahead:</strong> Tortellini can be cooked 2 days ahead. Toss in an airtight container with
                    a little oil to keep from sticking. Cover and chill. Broth can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool; cover
                    and chill. Reheat very gently, stirring constantly to re-emulsify (it may separate in the fridge),
                    before ladling over tortellini.</li>
