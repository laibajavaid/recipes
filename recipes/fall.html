    <h1>The Best Pumpkin Pie</h1>
    <p class="fall-recipe">The best pumpkin pie recipe need to do three things to succeed. They should have a perfectly
        spiced creamy filling. A crust that’s flaky yet tender. And, perhaps most important, they should seriously tempt
        anyone who’s choosing from a vast and competitive Thanksgiving dessert spread. This recipe does the trick, the
        sweetened condensed milk adds a decadent richness to the custard, while the perfect ratio of spices highlights
        the flavors of the pumpkin.</p>

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol class="prep-list">
                <li>Pulse <strong>sugar, salt, and 2 cups flour</strong> in a food processor until combined.
                    Add<strong>butter and lard</strong> and
                    pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pieces of butter and lard visible, about 15
                    one-second pulses. With motor running, drizzle in <strong>apple cider vinegar and 5½ tbsp ice
                        water</strong> and pulse until
                    dough is still crumbly but just holds together when squeezed (add 1 tsp. water at a time if
                    necessary, but be careful not to overwork dough).</li>
                <li>Turn out dough onto a work surface. Knead 1–2 times, pressing to incorporate any shaggy pieces.
                    Flatten into a 6"-wide disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill at least 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425°. Roll out dough on a lightly floured work surface to a 14" round. Transfer to a
                    9" pie dish. Pick up edges and allow dough to slump down into dish, letting excess dough hang over
                    dish. Trim, leaving about a 1" overhang. Fold overhang under; pinch and crimp. Chill 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325°. Whisk <strong>sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and cloves</strong> in a large bowl until
                    no clumps remain. Add <strong>eggs, pumpkin, condensed milk, cream, maple syrup, and vanilla</strong>  and whisk until
                    smooth. Pour into cooled crust. Bake pie until edges are set and slightly puffed but center is
                    recessed and wobbles like Jell-O, 60–75 minutes (it will continue to set after baking). Transfer to
                    a wire rack and let cool at least 3 hours before slicing. Serve with <strong>whipped cream</strong>.</li>
