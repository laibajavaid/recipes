    <h1>Vietnamese Inspired Turmeric Fish Summer Rolls</h1>
    <p class="summer-recipe">A dish of fried fish seasoned with turmeric, shrimp paste, and dill that’s served over
        vermicelli with lots of herbs and nước chấm, a fish sauce dressing. In Vietnam, summer roll dishes are usually
        served deconstructed with platters of crisp greens, herbs, and
        accoutrements so guests can assemble their own rolls.</p>

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol class="prep-list">
                <li>Slice <strong>4 Persian cucumbers</strong> lengthwise into planks that are about 3" long and 1/4"
                    thick. Cut off the
                    crown and the rounded bottom of <strong>1 pineapple</strong>, creating two flat surfaces. Stand the
                    pineapple up,
                    then use your knife to cut away the skin, following the contours of the pineapple from top to
                    bottom. Cut your pineapple in four long pieces, then remove the core. Cut the pineapple plank
                    crosswise into short 1/4" pieces. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Peel and finely chop one <strong>2" piece ginger</strong> and <strong>4–6 garlic cloves</strong>.
                    (You should have about 2 Tbsp.
                    each.) Mix 1 tbsp finely chopped ginger, 1 tbsp finely chopped garlic, <strong>tsp ground turmeric,
                        2 tbsp fish sauce, ½ tsp crushed red pepper flakes</strong>, and a <strong>pinch of kosher
                        salt</strong> in a small bowl. Cut <strong>1 lb white fish fillets, preferably skin-on</strong>,
                    into 4 equal pieces,
                    then massage marinade onto fish to coat evenly. Place in a shallow bowl or dish. Let marinate in the
                    fridge at least 30 minutes
                    and, preferably, up to 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the nước chấm dipping sauce. Stir <strong>1 tbsp sugar</strong> and <strong>5 tbsp
                    warm water</strong> in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Halve <strong>1 lime</strong> and squeeze 
                    in the juice (use your hand or a fine-mesh sieve to catch the seeds). Add a pinch of red pepper flakes if you’d like 
                    it to be spicy, remaining <strong>2 tbsp fish sauce</strong>, remaining 1 tbsp finely chopped ginger, and remaining 1 tbsp
                    finely chopped garlic. Stir to combine. Set aside for serving.</li>
                <li>Remove fish from refrigerator. Heat <strong>1 tbsp vegetable oil</strong> in a medium nonstick
                    skillet over medium.
                    Working in batches if needed, cook fish (start skin side down, if your fish has skin) until flesh is
                    opaque all the way through, firm, and flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer
                    to a plate and flake into smaller pieces.</li>
                <li>To assemble rolls, working one at a time, dip <strong>12 rice paper rounds</strong> in a clean
                    shallow bowl or pan of
                    hot water until pliable but not floppy, about 15 seconds. Lay flat on a large plate or cutting board
                    and arrange a piece or so of torn <strong>tender lettuce</strong>, some <strong>tender
                        herbs</strong>, a slice or two of the reserved
                    cucumber and pineapple, and a few pieces of fish horizontally across the center of wrappers, leaving
                    a 2" border on left and right sides. Fold left and right sides inward, then tightly roll wrapper
                    starting at the side nearest you. If you’d like to make rolls with exposed fillings, simply fold in
                    the left side of wrapper before adding fillings. Arrange fillings so that they overhang slightly on
                    the left side, then fold in the right side and roll up. Repeat until all of the fish has been used
                    (you should get 10–12 rolls). Serve with reserved nước chấm for dipping alongside.</li>
                <li>Alternatively, you can plate all of the components separately with a bowl of warm water for soaking
                    the wrappers and let guests assemble their own.</li>
                <li><strong>Do ahead:</strong> Nước chấm can be made 2 weeks ahead. Cover and chill.</li>
