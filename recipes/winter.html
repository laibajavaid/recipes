    <h1>Broccoli Cheddar Soup With Cheesy Croutons</h1>
    <p class="winter-recipe">This Broccoli Cheddar Soup is easy, creamy, and a perfect cozy classic. A silky-smooth
        base, bites of broccoli and cheesy croutons, and cheddar cheese. It boasts a creaminess that comes from blended
        potatoes and broccoli stalks rather than heavy cream or the roux that many recipes call for.</p>

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol class="prep-list">
                <li>Halve <strong>2 onions</strong>. Peel and coarsely chop. Peel and smash <strong>4 garlic
                        cloves</strong>, then coarsely chop. No need
                    to break out your best knife skills because it’s all going to get blended, but try to cut everything
                    into somewhat even pieces so they cook at the same rate.</li>
                <li>Melt <strong>3 tbsp unsalted butter</strong> in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-low heat. Add
                    onion, garlic,
                    and <strong>½ tsp red pepper flakes</strong>; season with <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>black
                        pepper</strong> (to taste). Stir to combine, then cover pot and
                    cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting to take on color, 8–10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, trim bottoms of <strong>2 heads of broccoli</strong>, then peel. Separate hefty stalks
                    from florets (the
                    thin, little stalks attached to broccoli tops are fine to leave attached to the crowns). Set aside
                    florets. Coarsely chop stalks into 1"–2" pieces. Peel <strong>1 medium russet potato</strong>.
                    Coarsely chop into
                    1"–2" pieces.</li>
                <li>Add broccoli stalks and potato pieces to pot and stir to coat in butter. Pour in <strong>5 cups
                        water</strong>, add
                    <strong>1 tbsp salt</strong>, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and keep
                    at a simmer.
                    Cover pot and cook until broccoli stalks and potatoes are completely tender (test with a cake
                    tester, paring knife, or fork), 20–25 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, chop reserved florets into small pieces (you can take the time to separate them into baby
                    florets or just have at them with your chef’s knife). Grate <strong>8 oz sharp cheddar
                        cheese</strong> on the large
                    holes of a box grater. You should have about 2 1/2 cups.</li>
                <li>Add half of florets to pot, cover, and cook until bright green, 3–5 minutes. Transfer to a blender,
                    let cool for 5 minutes, and purée until smooth. Some blender advice: Don't fill your blender more
                    than halfway—work in batches as necessary. To avoid explosions, remove the center lid from the
                    blender and cover with a kitchen towel. Alternatively, use an immersion blender. Your soup won’t be
                    quite as smooth, but it will still be great. Return purée to pot.</li>
                <li>Return to medium heat and add remaining florets. Cover pot and cook until bright green, another 3–5
                    minutes. Add <strong>2 cups cheddar cheese</strong> and stir until smooth. Cover and reduce heat to
                    low; set aside
                    while you make the cheddar croutons.</li>
                <li>Heat broiler. Broil <strong>4 thick slices rustic white bread</strong> on a rimmed baking sheet
                    until lightly browned (watch closely: broilers vary dramatically in power!), 2–3 minutes. Turn bread
                    over (soft side up), then sprinkle with <strong>reserved cheddar cheese</strong> and a few flecks of
                    <strong>red pepper flakes</strong>. Continue to broil until cheese is bubbling and browned in spots,
                    2–3 more minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Remove soup from heat and stir in <strong>½ cup plain Greek yogurt</strong>. Season generously with
                    <strong>black pepper</strong>; taste for <strong>salt</strong></li>
                <li>Cut cheese toasts into 1" (spoon-sized!) pieces. Divide soup among bowls. Top with cheddar croutons or 
                    reserved cheese.</li>
